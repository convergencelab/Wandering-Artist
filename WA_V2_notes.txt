For WA V2:
    - incorporate a object detection module, use reinforcement learning to get detected object
    in the proper frame of reference. So autonomously drive around until Ultrasound detects obstruction, use
    reinforcement learning to have robot detect object, with very good alignment
    in the image ( as centered as possible. ) .
    - incorporate NLP to make discussion about the image, GPT-3?
    - if NLP is doable, it would be funny to make an instagram for WA: https://pypi.org/project/instagram-python/
