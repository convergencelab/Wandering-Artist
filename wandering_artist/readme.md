This project will take a arduino, and gopro

robot will autonomously detect objects and perform style transfers on images
to make interesting interpretations of the world it is taking in

Section 1: Robot
The robot will be equiped with a ultrasound sensor to aid in the initial dection of objects. i.e.
if obstruction within x cm, run object detection with gopro. If object make artistic interpretation

Components:
- 2 gear motors
- 1 ultrasonic distance sensor
- 1 switch
- 1 motor driver
- jumper wires
- 1 sparkfun redboard

object detected: 
if ultrasound detects image: 
    turn 180 degrees and begin backing up until full object in image 
    and sensor behind is safe.
