WA_V1.1

This version is essentially the exact same as ver .0
But the way of which it implements object detection is different
instead of trying complete object detection while autonomously collecting data

just try to collect an abundance of images and perform image transfers on them later.

Also add simple modelling of environment.
 -> 2d map: we can estimate turns, and distance travelled forward/ back wards to have
 very rough estimate of where it sits in its plane.
